## Java Projects: 
1. **Gitlet**: a version control-system that mimics the basic features of the system Git. 
2. **Enigma**: simulation of the enigma machine through implementation of object-oriented programming, data structures, parsing files with RegEx.
3. **Ataxx**: a two-person game played with red and blue pieces on a 7-by-7 board with a built-in automated player. Concepts implemented include: machine learning, alpha-beta pruning, and game theory search tree algorithm.

## Python Projects:
1. **Cook County Housing (part 1)**: exploratory data analysis (EDA) of extensive housing data from Cook County, Illinois and data processing pipeline using *pandas*.
2. **Cook County Housing (part 2)**: usage of *scikit-learn* to build and fit linear models, feature engineering, and *matplotlib* on processed data from Cook County Housing (part 1). 
3. **Neural Net - ReLu vs. Sigmoid**: basic simulation of a neural network to explore the differences between ReLu and Sigmoid activation functions.
4. **Ants**: a tower defense game inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies mainly focusing on object-oriented programming. 
5. **Cats**: a program inspired by typeracer that measures typing speed with autocorrect.
6. **Hog**: simulation of a strategy-based two-player dice game. 


## Other: 
1. **Scheme**: an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language
